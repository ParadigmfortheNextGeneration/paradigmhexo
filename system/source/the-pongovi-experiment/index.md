The Pongovi Experiment is a testing ground. You could think of it as a laboratory, or a hacker space (socio-economic R&D).

To give the experiment the greatest chance of success, the first participants had to make decisions that were all or nothing, do or die, no way out.

The founding families pooled their savings to purchase a piece of land. The land was completely off-grid in a rainforest. No access to city utilities of any kind. No infrastructure at all on the property. The road was so bad, that at times it looked more like a creek bed (when it rained it was clear why). The front yard had a massive swamp (fed by a network of springs), with waste deep mud, and bush that was 20 to 30 feet high and tangled with mats of vines.

The minimal starting point (the first deliverable) for the project was an off-grid, adaptive learning center. This implied a physical base of operations (a piece of land in the middle of a rainforest). 

The abstract goals are to work with and transmit alternative approaches to production, exchange and social dynamics (while transitioning off of fossil fuels, debt based money, and vertical collectivism).

In the first iteration we built a shared kitchen, living area, bathroom and campground to host visitors, volunteers, and resident teachers. Mountains had to be terraced, swamps transformed into ponds, permaculture everywhere.

The way the experiment is designed compels participants to work with and integrate the core modules ([local resilience](/modules/local-resilience), [peaceful continuity](/modules/peaceful-continuity), [adaptive action](/modules/adaptive-action), and [modularity](/modules/modularity)).

The center is Open Source, non-transactional. Participants are not charged. Results are Creative Commons. 

The project has a core group of participants onsite (at Pongovi), and a small local network (on separate properties) committed to the same goals (each approaching the experiment from their own angle). 

At Pongovi, new participants are being added one at a time in the early iterations. To apply for the next iteration, visit the [volunteer page](/activism/volunteer) and **follow the instructions carefully**.
