This project is run entirely by volunteers (we currently have no paid staff). If you would like to help the cause by contributing your time and skills you can apply to collaborate with us online or onsite.

Note: Due to the fact that volunteers will be working with and communicating directly with our onsite team (and will require a significant investment of time on our part) we are only opening a small number of volunteer slots for the current iteration. Potential applicants will be evaluated according to skill, motivation, and availability. **To give your application the best chance of being selected, make sure follow the instructions carefully, and completely.**
