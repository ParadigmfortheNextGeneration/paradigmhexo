We are currently accepting applications for onsite volunteers with the following skill sets: 

* **Teachers/child development specialists** - Work with a small group of children ages 3 - 8, using a curiosity based learning approach. This position is currently only available for female applicants. Degree not required. Must have experience with kids.
* **Experienced Tradesmen** - Carpenters, electricians (preferably experienced with renewable technologies), mechanics, general handymen etc...
* **Animators/Video Editors/Videographers/UAV Operators** - Must bring your own equipment. You will retain footage, but must be willing to release as Creative Commons.
* **Programmers and Developers** - Back-end and front-end web developers and native app developers needed for work on open source communication, and information management systems. Must be comfortable with git. Experience with Nodejs/Javascript preferred.
* **Project Managers** - Must have experience with Agile/Scrum or some other adaptive project management approach.

 If you have a skill set which is not listed above, but which you feel might be helpful in the context of an off-grid learning center, or media outreach, your application may still be considered.
 
Applicants must be willing to purchase a round trip ticket to The Commonwealth of Dominica, and must be willing to stay at least one month. **Do not apply until you are ready to commit to a departure date less than two months away.**

Conditions onsite are rustic (you must be comfortable with the realities of living off-grid in a rainforest). Volunteers have access to a shared kitchen, bathroom and living space, but will need to bring their own tent. Experienced tradesmen will have the option to build a small cabin to use for the duration of their stay.
