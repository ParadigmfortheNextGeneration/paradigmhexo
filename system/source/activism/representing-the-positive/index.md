The Positive, and its associated colors (green, yellow, red, and blue on black), can be used by anyone who believes in the principles that it stands for. For example, one could print it onto a t-shirt,   bumper stickers, put it on buttons, or have it embroidered onto a patch. However if you take the step of wearing The Positive, it is important to be mindful of the fact that you will be acting as something of an ambassador.

**+ It is of utmost importance that all contact with the public while representing the positive be calm, honest, and respectful.**

Start by seeking a point of agreement right away and expand from there. Among the general population the local resilience meme is usually the most accessible, however within some niche groups (such as a conflict resolution meet-up, or an Agile development community) one of the other core modules may be a more appropriate starting point.

Make sure you know the core modules ([local resilience](/modules/local-resilience), [adaptive action](/modules/adaptive-action), [modularity](/modules/modularity), [peaceful continuity](/modules/peaceful-continuity), and [tribal identity](/modules/tribal-identity)) backwards and forwards. One way to achieve this is to immerse yourself in documentaries, books and articles on these topics. Taking notes and reformulating the ideas into your own words will help you integrate them more deeply. Engaging in respectful and calm debate with those who disagree is the ultimate test.

If in the course of a conversation you are confronted with an idea that you do not know how to respond to, this should be viewed as an opportunity to deepen your research. Under no circumstances should you pretend to know or understand something that you do not.  Be humble enough to acknowledge when you don't have an answer.
