Those who want to get ahead of the curve and help others do the same; those who really want to change the world, have their homework cut out for them.  

There's a lot to absorb. Some of what you need to learn isn't taught in school. Some realities are impossible to fully integrate just by reading a book. Study cannot replace experience.

In the next iteration there will be 5 slots available for online training, and one slot available onsite.

Subject matter includes local resilience, adaptive action, modularity, meme science and social dynamics.

To apply, send an email to <strong class="obscure" data-obscure="paradigmforthenextgeneration%gmail&com"></strong> with the following information **(in order)**:

* Include the word "Online Training" or "Onsite Training" in the email subject.
* Provide your name, age, gender and nationality
* Provide us with an email address associated with a google drive account (for document sharing). 
* Describe your intentions, goals and, commitments in 1000 words or less. This statement should connect to at least one of the [core modules](/modules).
