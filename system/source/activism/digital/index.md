The internet provides us with an unprecedented opportunity to disseminate ideas on a global scale. To use this tool effectively we must understand and apply the principles of social psychology to modern vectors of communication.

There are an infinite number of ways to spread ideas online. The following list is intended to serve as a springboard, but is by no means exhaustive:

* Share, like, retweet or link to compatible content on social media.
* Create a blog or social media account and build up an audience.
* Contact and build relationships with thought leaders (bloggers/social media admins)
* Use online comments strategically.
* Create or join online discussion groups oriented towards compatible topics, and participate strategically.
* Troll for Truth: Work in teams to counter ideas online in coordinated bursts.

 If you are interested in helping coordinate online activists, or if you have technical skills (such as programming) which you are willing to contribute, apply to [volunteer](/activism/volunteer) onsite or online.
