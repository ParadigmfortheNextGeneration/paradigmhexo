**It is of utmost importance that all contact with the public be calm, honest, and respectful.**

Start by seeking a point of resonance right away and expand from there. Among the general population local resilience is usually the most accessible meme to start with, however within some niche groups (such as a conflict resolution meet-up, or an Agile development forum) one of the other core modules may be a more appropriate starting point.

Make sure you know the core modules ([local resilience](/modules/local-resilience), [adaptive action](/modules/adaptive-action), [modularity](/modules/modularity), [peaceful continuity](/modules/peaceful-continuity), and [tribal identity](/modules/tribal-identity)) backwards and forwards. One way to achieve this is to immerse yourself in documentaries, books and articles on related topics. Taking notes and reformulating the ideas into your own words will help you integrate them more deeply. 

Engaging in respectful and calm debate with those who disagree with you is an important test of both intellectual and emotional development. Seek first to understand. Teach by asking questions. Prioritize the relationship over the short term win.

Be humble enough to acknowledge when you don't have an answer. If in the course of a conversation you are confronted with an idea that you do not know how to respond to, this should be viewed as an opportunity to deepen your research. Under no circumstances should you pretend to know or understand something that you do not.
