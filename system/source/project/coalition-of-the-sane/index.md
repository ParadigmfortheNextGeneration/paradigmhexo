The United States (and by extension the entire planet) is cruising into treacherous waters.
Chances are you sense this on some level.
**That's why you're here.**

### It has become obvious at this point<br/> that as a society we are drifting towards a storm.

It may have dawned on you that the-powers-that-be are out of their league,
that the official opposition doesn't have a viable plan,
and the 11th hour is upon us.

### Right now we have a very narrow window of opportunity, a chance to shape the arc of history

In times of crisis, group and national identities become volatile, and can be manipulated by those who understand the principles of crowd psychology.

**To form a coherent/effective response it is imperative to have an anchor; a line in the sand; an ethical core to rally upon.**

For some people, this list might seem incomplete, to be missing pieces... Perhaps. However, every element added to  a platform shaves off support, and splinters alliances.
**Rather than debate, we encourage you to perform the following experiment:** Approach an equal number of self identified conservatives, progressives, libertarians, anarchists etc... and show them the three planks. Ask them if they agree with the principles. Next, show them your modified list (adding what you think is missing) and ask them again. Record the results and compare. You could also test this with completely new subjects in the opposite order.
