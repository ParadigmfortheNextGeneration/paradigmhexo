This project is open source, not-for-profit (we do not utilize advertising of any kind). Donations enable us to produce content, maintain servers, and improve conditions at our off-grid, adaptive learning center (which also serves as our international base of operations).

We currently operate with an extremely limited electrical system (two 190 watt solar panels). This makes video editing exceptionally difficult. Upgrading this system is our current priority.
