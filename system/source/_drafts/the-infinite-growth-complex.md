As a species we are sleep walking towards the unthinkable on multiple fronts.
Politicians and pundits offer band-aids for the symptoms, 
but they never discuss the underlying disease, the root of the problem.

Most who see where we're headed feel powerless. 
The democratic process is rigged.
The so called leaders corrupt and cartoonish.
Money buys access.
Pay to play.

We are hooked on a socio-economic model that rewards destructive behavior, 
elevates clinical psychopaths to positions of power, 
and [leaves the vast majority of the worlds population hanging by a thread](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/09/23/seven-in-ten-people-globally-live-on-10-or-less-per-day/).

Most don't even want to look at the problem, much less work towards a solution. 
The scale is too overwhelming, the implications too horrific.

Just trying to keep your heads above water.
 Living paycheck to paycheck. 
Struggling to make ends meet. 
**This is by design.**

## Debt Based Scarcity
*Why is it that growth is such an essential metric in macro-economics?*

Modern economies must expand perpetually to avoid collapse.
In fact the term "economic sustainability" is traditionally defined as a steady growth in GDP of at least 2% per year.
Clearly this is an oxymoron.
We live on a finite planet, with finite resources.
Infinite growth is not a long term survival strategy. 

Any proposed solution which fails to address this issue,
is rearranging deck chairs on the titanic.

[Can we all agree meme]

The root of the infinite growth paradigm (and it's myriad symptoms), is debt based money.

Every dollar, euro and peso in circulation is created by banks loaning out money that they don't have. 

The lion's share of this new currency, 97% in fact, is created by ordinary private banks like Wells Fargo, Deutsche Bank and Societe Generale, when you sign over your future labor for a house, a car, an education, a new business, or a credit card.

They dictate the terms. Which means you'll be paying mostly interest for years, hardly touching the principle. 

They've got most businesses and governments over the barrel as well. 
Now you know who you really work for. 
It's one big company store.

Banks write hot checks, type dollars into existence, and nobody goes to jail! 
This practice is not only legal, it is in fact the foundation of the current financial system. It's called Fractional Reserve Banking.
And that is just the tip of the iceberg.

Since all currency is actually debt, paying off all debt would automatically cancel out all money.

This however is technically impossible.
Loans are not free, remember the interest.
The money to pay back that interest is not created by the loan.
In fact it is never created at all.

There is always more total debt than money in circulation.

It's a spiral, a pyramid scheme,
and a game of musical chairs.
The music keeps playing as long as credit flows.

But the music always stops eventually, and some get left without a chair.

While banks have a license to write hot checks,
everyone else is forced to compete within that insufficient pool of liquidity.
Bankruptcy is inevitable, by design.

The banks then seize the real, tangible assets tied to the loans (then get bailed out by the tax payer).

They take your home, they take your car, they take your business, they leave you in poverty.

Some refer to this state of affairs as Artificial Scarcity.

It's a rigged game that keeps you on the hamster wheel,
working jobs you can't stand,
selling your life force for digits in a bank account.

Modern day feudalism,
equal opportunity enslavement.
It's also by definition unsustainable.

[Monetary Feudalism]

Even if it weren't for the fact that we live on a finite planet with finite resources (a minor detail), all fractional reserve monetary systems have a trajectory that leads to a systemic breaking point, baked in the cake, by design.

## The Breaking Point

National debt expands slowly at first, but inevitably accelerates, then goes exponential.
 
When entire countries can't pay, the stakes are high, especially for the ruling class.
They know what could happen if they get pinned with the blame.

The "powers that be" prefer to tip the game board, rewrite history, and start again.
It's amazing at what you can get away with in the fog of war.

The last round (aka World War II) was consummated at Bretton Woods in 1945. Uncle Sam was young and strong, and holding the biggest stick. So he got to write the rules.

The Bretton Woods  Agreement established the U.S. Dollar as the world reserve currency, supposedly backed by gold (at a fixed rate of $35 an ounce).
Federal Reserve notes would be the go-to for international trade.

It a setup, a bait and switch.
Banks always inflate the money supply,
and the government had no intention of stopping them.
It was just a matter of time.

The Nixon Shock began in 1971, accelerating just before exponential.
As inflation went airborne, countries began to call in their gold.
It would have been game-over, but Nixon rewrote the rules.

[Nixon Clip]

After ending the gold standard, Nixon then "persuaded" (coerced) all of OPEC to only sell their oil in U.S. dollars. Remember, Uncle Sam still had the biggest stick.
This was one of those deals you couldn't refuse.

Locking down the sale of oil created an inherent demand for U.S. currency. 
Debt based economies have to grow, the more they grow, the more oil they consume, the more dollars they spend.
Supply meets demand, the dollar's true value.

The strengthening dollar was offset by inflation (which would of course be exported).
So there was no need to worry about national debt.
Washington could run up the tab indefinitely at everyone else's expense (so they did).

This was the birth of the Petrodollar empire.

The labor and resources of an entire planet were held hostage by infinite growth and a way of life inextricably tied to oil.

Transport, manufacturing, agriculture, medicine...
human society is addicted to fossil fuels on every level.

Modern cities and highways are designed with automobiles in mind.
Food production, industry and office complexes moved farther and farther away from suburban sprawl.
Inhabitants totally dependent on the flow of goods from afar.

**Oil isn't just a commodity, it's a socio-economic chokepoint.**
It keeps things the way they are.

Those who profit from this chokepoint know it must be guarded and maintained.
If a large enough block stops selling in dollars it'll be game over.
So examples must be made of upstarts:
Regime change, sanctions and long term blockades (Uncle Sam's big stick).

[Wesley Clark Clip]

They've got blood on their hands. Lot's of it.
Maintaining an empire is a nasty business.
You've got to break more than a few eggs to make these ommelettes.

[Albright Clip]

## Cognitive Dissonance

But the American public identifies as the perpetual good guy,
a city on the hill, a purveyor of peace and democracy.
If you want to start a war, you can't just tell people how it really works.
You can't just explain that their current standard of living depends upon it.

To get them to send their brothers, sons and fathers to kill and be killed
requires a cover story, a boogie man, and talking heads to wrap it in a flag.
Problem, Reaction, Solution.
**Hegelian Geopolitics.**

<div class="injection_html" data-injection-html="hegelian_geopolitics.html"></div>

[Mockingbird]

They had a good run with it.
But all empires fall.

Geopolitical, economic and ideological competitors rise, 
as the culture splinters and fragments from within.

Technological advancements accelerate this process (instant communication, automated manufacturing etc..).
History has become visible at the human scale.
It's not slowing it down.

## The Window of Opportunity

This is end of an era (a super-cycle),
which opens a window of opportunity.

Within that window we have a chance to shape the arc of history,
by exposing the nature of the game board (before and as it's tipped),
and by pointing towards something new.

The Military, Petrodollar, Fractional Reserve/Infinite Growth Complex cannot be understood (or defeated) in isolation. 
Leave one head uncut and we're back to square one.

Oil is a socio-economic chokepoint.
It forces us to interact with the system, locks us into debt based money and the infinite growth hamster wheel.
To break free, city design, manufacturing, agriculture and commerce must be decoupled from fossil fuels, and infinite consumption.

This requires a design paradigm which reduces dependence on external inputs,
facilitates local production and exchange,
Minimizes waste and distance traveled,
Maximizes efficiency, modularizes and stacks functions.

Don't expect the "powers that be" to make it happen. 
For politicians, issues are sound bites,
used to pander to a specific demographic.
They study you; tell you what they know you want to hear;
distract with illusions of hope and change (psychological slight of hand).

In the end they serve those who line their pockets.
Money buys access. 
Pay to play.

[Who controls the world]

These haircuts in suits don't deserve your obedience.
They don't deserve your respect.
So don't beg at their feet.
Don't ask their permission.
Don't give them a chance to stand in your way.

Their wealth flows from the sweat of your brow.
It's not their power, it yours.

If enough of you figure this out it's game over.
That's why they pit you against each other,
by manipulating and provoking artificial group identities.
**Divide and conquer makes you easy to control.**

The monopoly on money must be taken back from the banks,
decentralized, and never returned.
This calls for economic models and vectors of exchange
that render the current system irrelevant,
then obsolete.

## The Transition 

The mind is the root of power

The dominant cultural narrative is an invisible dictator, guarded by sacred fairy tales and nonsensical assumptions which you have been conditioned to accept as your own.
It is the lynchpin of a system that isolates us as individuals and families, fragments and weakens us as communities, and conditions us to wait for someone else to act.
To break free, and to give our children and grandchildren a chance to, 
we must question EVERYTHING.

As the circus tent of civilization teeters, and the narrative cords which hold it loosen,
ideological chokepoints: media, education, dogma must be taken, decentralized, and reinvented;
broken orthodoxy torn down.
Such power vacuums only open momentarily. Time is of the essence.

The current education paradigm conditions children for a life of subservience and menial labor, 
brightened only by the hope of bigger cubicle, money, and the social validation it affords. 
It frames history, and the boundaries of the possible, in boxes conducive to the status quo, 
 a world that is coming to an end.

The seismic transformations that lie ahead will prioritize very different skill sets, 
and will call for new strains of intelligence.
The next generation must be prepared accordingly.

## Open Source Civilization 

No one can own an idea.
Locking down information as intellectual property, 
impedes the proliferation of solutions, 
and holds us back as a species.

(It's also censorship tool of a technocratic plutocracy.)

The next generation needs a design paradigm that integrates what works, and discards what doesn't;
results open sourced to the public domain.
Previous experiments inform the next.

Any idea worth holding, must be worth testing (at an appropriate scale).
Beliefs must synchronize with logic and evidence (aka reality).
This is the essence of the scientific method.

The open source approach accelerates innovation, lowers economic barriers, increases efficiency, and leads to better outcomes.

Proven designs, metrics and principles are standardized;
systems decoupled into stable modules and components (for repair, replacement and upgrade).

It works for science, software development, and manufacturing. 
Imagine applying it to the way humans organize and live.

## The Primal Identity

We don't have time to waste reinventing wheels.
We must study the mistakes of the past,
with a grounded understanding of who we are.

Homo sapiens sapiens is a social animal;
a tribe the human analogue of a pack.
(It's also the most stable social configuration human groups have come up with yet).
This instinct pre-dates humanity, and will persist.
Failure to account for it invites tragedy.

In times of upheaval nations and superstates shatter and become many.
New tribes are born along fault lines of geography, language, and group identity; 
unified by *percieved* threats, as strong-men, demagogues and religions rise to fill the void.

These are treacherous waters.
Don't wait for someone else to lead.
The next generation needs the path to be cleared,
pragmatic examples to emulate, and an idea to spread like a virus of perception.

Ideas replicate themselves with greater fidelity when they are simple, compact and minimally bundled.
Memes are the ideological equivalent of the codons that make up genes.

For an idea to survive it must be adapted to its environment.
Ideological habitat dictates selective pressures (the cultural status quo).
Sometimes hybridization is key.

Socio-economic experiments are dangerous.
Ideals tend to be enforced by the barrel of a gun. 
You're never going to get every culture and subculture on this planet to agree on the proper way to live, or erase all borders of us and them (in-group/out-group/the minimal group paradigm).
Such idealism runs against the grain of our primal identity,
and is therefore, doomed to fail.

So beware of one-size-fits-all, global solutions.
Grand socio-economic designs defined in detail, imposed on all, 
end in war and atrocities committed for the common good.

Start small.
Work with what you have.
Set realistic goals, and take steps to achieve them.
The revolution might begin with a garden in your front yard.
