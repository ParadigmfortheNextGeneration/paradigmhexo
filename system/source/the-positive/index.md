* The green outer line represents [local resilience](/modules/local/resilience).
* The yellow represents [peaceful continuity](/modules/peaceful-continuity) (consensus building, non-aggression, conflict resolution).
* The red represents [adaptive action](/modules/adaptive-action).
* The blue represents [modularity and meme science](/modules/modularity).
* The black represents an inclusive [identity](/modules/tribal-identity) (black absorbs all colors).

### No wars of aggression.
