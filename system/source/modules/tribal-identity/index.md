Homo Sapiens Sapiens is a social animal.
National identity is a proxy for tribe.
Tribe is the human analogue of a pack ([cultural modularity](/modules/modularity/cultural-modularity)).

In the early 1970s social psychologist Henri Tajfel set out to study the minimal conditions required for discrimination to occur between groups of humans. In his tests he discovered that group identity could be easily formed in a very short time using trivial criteria (such as one's musical preferences or the results of a coin toss), and that groups divided by such trivia would immediately display prejudice against those on the other side,and favor those in the same arbitrary category. He referred to this principle as The Minimal Group Paradigm. It's the psychological root of tribal identity.
 
This instinct pre-dates humanity, and will persist. Failure to account for it invites tragedy.

The pack instinct is a survival adaptation. It is triggered by physical insecurity. Those who are able to coordinate their efforts with those around them are able to accomplish exponentially more than those who attempt to go it alone. This provides a selective pressure that will always come into play during times of upheaval.

Groups which define and maintain a strong shared identity are more stable than those which do not. This provides a selective pressure which will always come into play during times of upheaval.
