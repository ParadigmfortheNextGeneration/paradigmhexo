Adaptive project management (aka iterative, non-linear, or agile) is an approach which focuses on releasing a simple, functional product in a short time frame, testing, then making incremental improvements based on feedback.

* **Define the Abstract Goal** - Define what the product needs to accomplish in the broadest sense.
* **Prioritize** - Define the most important/urgent goals.
*  **Choose a short term deliverable** - Build a minimal first version.
* **Test and reassess** - Use feedback/results to guide next iteration.
