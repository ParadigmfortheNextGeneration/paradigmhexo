Systems are more stable, and easier to repair and update when they are built using simple, compact and minimally bundled components. In systems design this principle is referred to as modularity. 

Richard Dawkins coined the term "meme" to represent minimal clusters of ideas. In the context of an ideological system we can use "module" and "meme" interchangeably.

The following modules/memes are designed to be combined and integrated into existing ideologies. To maximize cultural reach, we must embrace hybrid systems.

## Core Modules

* **[Local Resilience](/modules/local-resilience)**
* **[Peaceful Continuity](/modules/peaceful-continuity)**
* **[Adaptive Action](/modules/adaptive-action)**
* **[Modularity](/modules/modularity)**
* **[Tribal Identity](/modules/tribal-identity)**

## Core Narrative
The core modules can be tied together by [narrative](/modules/modularity/narrative-and-meme-systems) to form a meme system.

**Local resilience implies converging, forming coalitions, and teams, getting our local community involved. Non-aggression, conflict resolution, and consensus building will make the transition more peaceful. The adaptive approach will make us more effective. Identity holds us together.**
