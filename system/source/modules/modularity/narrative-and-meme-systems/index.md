Narratives are stories that connect [memes](/modules/modularity/memes-as-modules) (small, stable clusters of ideas), to form meme systems. 

Meme systems which define one's place in the world combine to form [identity](/modules/tribal-identity).

Cultural narratives define identity and world view by dictating which ideas receive focus and respect, and which are mocked or ignored.
