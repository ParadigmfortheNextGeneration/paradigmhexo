Applied to human culture, a tribe is a [modular component](/modules/modularity). Historically speaking, tribes are by far the most stable, and durable socio-economic configuration ever tested.

The tribal model can be extended to a larger scale through federations. In this context we can think of federations as modular systems. Example: the Iroquois Confederacy.
