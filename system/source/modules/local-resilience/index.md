<blockquote>We must transition NOW towards local systems of production, exchange, and decision making. We must maximize efficiency, reduce inputs, waste and distance traveled. We must start with small, testable solutions that can be implemented right now without the sanction or assistance of those in power.</blockquote>

Modern humans are completely dependent on the flow of goods and resources from afar. Transport, manufacturing, agriculture, and medicine are all tied to fossil fuels.
Cities and highways are designed with automobiles in mind. Food production, industry and office complexes moved farther and farther away from suburban sprawl. And all of it at the mercy of a debt based monetary system whose ebbs and flows we do not control, a system predicated on infinite growth on a finite planet.  

Local resilience is a [modular component](/modules/modularity) (meme). This meme contains a replication imperative (the urgency to transition off of a dying system).

## Submodules

* **Production** - We must reduce our reliance on goods and resources from afar.
* **Exchange** - We must reduce our dependence on debt based money, and the infinite growth paradigm.
* **Decision Making/Security** - We must transition to small, localized models of social organization ([cultural modularity](/modules/modularity/cultural-modularity)). [Consensus building, non-aggression, and conflict resolution](/modules/peaceful-continuity) will make this process more peaceful. The [adaptive approach](/modules/adaptive-action) will make us more effective.
